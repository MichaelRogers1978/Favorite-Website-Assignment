I chose the website for this lesson to be naturesplayground outfitters.com as my favorite website. The reason why I chose this website is because it is my website/store. I own it so there wouldn't be any type of infringing on any copyrights or anything like that.
I used several bootstrap elements it this assignment such as the nav-bar with the nav class, a class, button class with the ul and the li class to collapse into a toggle, "hamburger" menu. The hero section, I used the image class with text in it by using the the flex box. The cards on the Catagories page include images, text and button in them by using the image src, card-body, card-title, and card-text with the btn-success. I used the centering of the cards with the row justify-content-center. 
I would defineatly like to make it better such as making more sections to shop with the push of the shop now button on the home page. Have the catagories cards display more catagories with the enter here take you to a shopping page for that catagory. Have the Contact us page enter into having the user create a user account and have a check out system for purchases of products.
